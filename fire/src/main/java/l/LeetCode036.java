     36. Valid Sudoku

     Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

     Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

     Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

     Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

     Note:

     A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

     Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

     Example 1:


     Input: board =
     [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
     ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
     ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
     ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
     ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
     ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
     ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
     ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
     ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
     Output: true
     Example 2:

     Input: board =
     [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
     ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
     ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
     ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
     ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
     ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
     ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
     ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
     ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
     Output: false
     Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.


     Constraints:

     board.length == 9
     board[i].length == 9
     board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
